## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
You need a userscript manager extension installed in your browser:

- **Chrome/Edge/Brave**: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdaq)
- **Firefox**: [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
- **Safari**: [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887)

### Steps

1. **Install a userscript manager** (see links above)
2. **Click here to install**: [word-definition-popup.user.js](https://github.com/doniwicaksono/word-definition-popup/raw/refs/heads/main/word-definition-popup.user.js)
3. **Confirm installation** in the userscript manager popup
4. **Done!** Start selecting words on any webpage

## üìñ Usage

1. **Select any word** on any webpage
2. **Wait 300ms** (debounce delay)
3. **See the definition** appear near your cursor

### Supported Word Types
- Single English words (1-30 characters)
- Words with hyphens (e.g., "self-aware")
- Words with apostrophes (e.g., "don't")

### Hiding the Popup
The popup automatically hides when you:
- Click anywhere outside the popup
- Start scrolling
- Press the **ESC** key
- Select new text

## üé® Adaptive Theming

The popup intelligently adapts to your website's design:

### Background Color Detection
- Traverses DOM tree to find first non-transparent background
- Falls back to body/html background if needed
- Slightly adjusts color for better popup visibility

### Text Color Adaptation
- Uses the same text color from the selected text
- Inherits the website's typography colors
- Ensures perfect readability across all themes

### Smart Positioning
- Appears near your cursor
- Auto-adjusts when near viewport edges
- Never clips off-screen

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The script works out-of-the-box, but you can customize it by editing these values:

```javascript
// Debounce delay (ms)
debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {}, 300); // Change 300 to your preference

// Max word length
text.length < 30 // Change 30 to allow longer words

// Popup max width
max-width: 320px; // Edit in CSS

// Number of definitions shown
const meanings = entry.meanings.slice(0, 3); // Change 3 to show more/less
```

## üîß Technical Details

### API
Uses the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) for word definitions:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}`
- **No authentication required**
- **No rate limiting** (reasonable usage)

### Color Detection Algorithm
1. Parse element's computed background and text colors
2. Calculate luminance using WCAG formula
3. Determine if background is dark or light
4. Adjust popup colors accordingly

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Caching**: Same word won't trigger new API call
- **Minimal DOM**: Single popup element reused
- **Event delegation**: Efficient event handling
- **Lazy loading**: Font loaded asynchronously

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Popup not appearing?
- Ensure the word is 2-30 characters long
- Check that it contains only English letters, hyphens, or apostrophes
- Verify userscript manager is enabled

### Wrong colors?
- The script inherits colors from the webpage
- Some websites use complex color schemes
- Try selecting text from different page elements

### Definition not found?
- Not all words are in the dictionary
- Try singular form (e.g., "book" instead of "books")
- Slang and very new words may not be available

### Popup position issues?
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser zoom level (100% recommended)
- Report edge cases as GitHub issues

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
You need a userscript manager extension installed in your browser:

- **Chrome/Edge/Brave**: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdaq)
- **Firefox**: [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
- **Safari**: [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887)

### Steps

1. **Install a userscript manager** (see links above)
2. **Click here to install**: [word-definition-popup.user.js](https://github.com/doniwicaksono/word-definition-popup/raw/refs/heads/main/word-definition-popup.user.js)
3. **Confirm installation** in the userscript manager popup
4. **Done!** Start selecting words on any webpage

## 📖 Usage

1. **Select any word** on any webpage
2. **Wait 300ms** (debounce delay)
3. **See the definition** appear near your cursor

### Supported Word Types
- Single English words (1-30 characters)
- Words with hyphens (e.g., "self-aware")
- Words with apostrophes (e.g., "don't")

### Hiding the Popup
The popup automatically hides when you:
- Click anywhere outside the popup
- Start scrolling
- Press the **ESC** key
- Select new text

## 🎨 Adaptive Theming

The popup intelligently adapts to your website's design with guaranteed readability:

### Background Color Detection
- **Deep DOM traversal** (up to 20 levels) to find backgrounds
- Handles **semi-transparent** overlays and complex layouts
- Prioritizes **solid colors** (opacity ≥ 80%)
- Falls back through: element → body → html → system preference
- Works perfectly on sites like **Bluesky, Twitter/X, Reddit** in dark mode

### Text Color Adaptation
- Uses the same text color from the selected text
- **Automatic contrast checking** using WCAG standards
- Falls back to black/white if contrast ratio is below 4.5:1
- Ensures perfect readability in all scenarios

### Smart Positioning
- Appears near your cursor
- Auto-adjusts when near viewport edges
- Never clips off-screen

### Contrast Ratio Algorithm
The script uses the WCAG 2.1 formula to calculate contrast ratios:

```javascript
// Ensures 4.5:1 minimum contrast for normal text (WCAG AA)
// Automatically corrects poor contrast scenarios
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

The script works out-of-the-box, but you can customize it by editing these values:

```javascript
// Debounce delay (ms)
debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {}, 300); // Change 300 to your preference

// Max word length
text.length < 30 // Change 30 to allow longer words

// Popup max width
max-width: 320px; // Edit in CSS

// Number of definitions shown
const meanings = entry.meanings.slice(0, 3); // Change 3 to show more/less

// DOM traversal depth
const maxDepth = 20; // Increase for even deeper scanning

// Minimum contrast ratio
if (contrastRatio < 4.5) // Change 4.5 for different standards
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API
Uses the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) for word definitions:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}`
- **No authentication required**
- **No rate limiting** (reasonable usage)

### Color Detection Algorithm
1. **Traverse DOM tree** up to 20 levels deep
2. **Collect all non-transparent backgrounds** with opacity > 0.1
3. **Prioritize solid colors** with opacity ≥ 0.8
4. **Parse computed styles** including rgba values
5. **Calculate luminance** using WCAG formula:
   ```
   L = 0.2126 × R + 0.7152 × G + 0.0722 × B
   ```
6. **Check contrast ratio** between text and background:
   ```
   CR = (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)
   ```
7. **Auto-correct** text color if contrast < 4.5:1
8. **Fallback chain**: element → body → html → `prefers-color-scheme`

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Caching**: Same word won't trigger new API call
- **Minimal DOM**: Single popup element reused
- **Event delegation**: Efficient event handling
- **Lazy loading**: Font loaded asynchronously
- **Smart traversal**: Stops at first solid background

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Popup not appearing?
- Ensure the word is 2-30 characters long
- Check that it contains only English letters, hyphens, or apostrophes
- Verify userscript manager is enabled

### Wrong colors or poor contrast?
- **v1.2.1 fixed this!** The script now ensures WCAG AA compliance
- If issues persist, check browser console for debug logs
- Report specific websites as GitHub issues with screenshots

### Popup has white background on dark sites?
- **Fixed in v1.2.1** with enhanced background detection
- The script now traverses deeper and handles opacity correctly
- Works on Bluesky, Twitter/X, Reddit, and other complex dark themes

### Definition not found?
- Not all words are in the dictionary
- Try singular form (e.g., "book" instead of "books")
- Slang and very new words may not be available

### Popup position issues?
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser zoom level (100% recommended)
- Report edge cases as GitHub issues

### Debug Mode
To see detailed theme detection logs:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Select a word
3. Look for "Theme applied:" logs showing detected colors
